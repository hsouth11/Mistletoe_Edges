Variable,Type,Definition
tree_id,character,"Unique identifier of each tree. Format: x#, where x is r (regen) or m (mature) and # is a sequential number, ascending from 1 to N (sample size) for each tree type (regen, mature). Assigned when tree entered into data after field season. "
flag_id,character,"Identifier of the marking flag used to mark the tree in the field. Only used for keeping track of trees in the field, not used as an identifier after that. Format: x#, where x is y (yellow flag) or w (white flag) and # is number written on the flag. Can be matched to data on paper datasheets if necessary to check on observation. "
site_id,character,"Unique identifier of edge spread research sites. Name format: xx_# where xx identifies the location (mk = Malcom Knapp Research Forest, mi = Mission Municipal Forest, cr = Campbell River area, ph = Pacfific Highway near town of Ucluelet) and the numbers ascend from 1 to N (sample size) at each location (e.g. mk_1, mk_2, mk_3). "
plot_id,integer,"For ""tree_type = mature"" this the number identifying the stem mapping plot this tree was mapped from (identified by rebar stakes with grey plot tag at research sites). For ""tree_type = regen"", this is the number identifying the transect this tree falls on (identified by rebar stakes with the RED plot tag at research sites); for regen trees, this maps to the ""transect_id"" field in the transect_data. "
dist_x_tr,numeric,"Distance to the centre of the tree stem perpendicular from the transect (identified by plot_id) centre line at ""dist_y_tr"". In meters to one decimal. Looking from the transect start to the transect end, left is negative, right is positive. Ranges from -2.5 to 2.5. Only defined for ""tree_type = regen""."
dist_y_tr,numeric,"Slope distance on the transect, read from the transect (identified by ""plot_id"") line. In meters to one decimal. Ranges from 0.0 to end of transect. Only defined for ""tree_type = regen""."

Species present in data: ""Ba"" = amabilis fir (Abies amabilis), ""Bl"" = subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), ""Cw"" = western red cedar (Thuja plicata), ""Dr"" = red alder (Alnus rubra), ""Ep"" = paper birch (Betula papyrifera), ""Fd"" = Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), ""Hw"" = western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), ""Mb"" = big leaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), ""Mv"" = vine maple (Acer circinatum), ""U"" = unknown,  ""V"" = cherry (Prunus) . Species considered trees and their codes are from: BC Ministry of Forests and Range & BC Ministry of Environment (Eds.). (2010). Field manual for describing terrestrial ecosystems (2nd ed.)."
status,factor,"One of: ""LS"" = live standing (live trees that are  self-supporting, meaning the tree would remain standing if all supporting  materials were removed), LL = ""live leaning"" (live trees that are  self-supporting but have obvious lean), live fallen = ""LF"" (live trees that are  not self-supporting, meaning the tree would not remain standing if all  supporting materials were removed), ""DS"" = dead standing (dead trees that are self-supporting), ""SN"" = snag (a dead standing tree that has snapped  somewhere in its bole). Adapted from the ""Large Tree Status Codes"" (pg. 120)  in Natural Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Service. (2008). Canada’s National  Forest Inventory ground sampling guidelines: Specifications for ongoing  measurement. (5th ed.). Library and Archives Canada. ""LL"" class added because crown position likely influences dispersal of misltetoe seed from a tree. ""SN"" added because these trees typically appeared to have died longer ago than ""DS"" trees and when in the mature component, would have been an infection source for a shorter period. Neither of these additional classes were used in analyses. Future remeasurement could use the standard three classes: ""LS"", ""LF"", ""DS"". "

Only defined for live trees (""status = LS or LL or LF""). Dead trees (""status = DS or SN) set to ""-"". Adapted from Natural Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Service. (2008). Canada’s National Forest Inventory ground sampling guidelines: Specifications for ongoing measurement. (5th ed.). Library and Archives Canada. In source guidelines, crown class is not defined for ""LF"" trees; we recorded it in this data because crown position is an important determinant of a potential as a source tree or target tree for mistletoe seed.

height,numeric,"Tree height. In meters to one decimal. Measured for a subsample dominant/codominant western hemlock (3 regen trees/transect = 9 trees/site; 3 mature trees/stem mapping plot = 12 trees/site). For western hemlock trees that have an apical droop, we extended the height to estimate the total height if the droop was pulled straight. One exception is site cr_3, where all crown classes were measured. Future remeasurements should consider measuring heights for all live hemlocks in all crown classes. "
