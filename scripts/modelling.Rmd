This script fits ordinal models that predict DMR from tree level variables. 
Originally, the intent was to build a model that tested the significance and 
predictive ability of of tree (dbh, canopy class, seed load, distance from the 
edge) and site (e.g. stem density, climate vars) variables and combinations. 
This is still reflected in the set up, where all the variables are assembled 
in a single dataframe. Quickly, we ran into model instabilities and had to go
with a simpler approach. In the simpler version, DMR is collapsed to a subset 
of the 6 levels (to treat problems of data scarcity), only tree level 
predictors are considered and site level predictors are all wrapped up into a 
random site effect. 

The starting object for this is the trees_sl.csv object that came out of the 
seed load script. Various other variables are pulled from different places.

#Generate modelling dataset
##Read in datasets
First task is to pull together various datasets into a single dataframe for 
modelling. This dataset is at the tree level - i.e. each row is a tree with 
associated attributes. These attributes can be at the site, transect or tree 
level. 
```{r}
rm(list = ls(all = TRUE))
set.seed(11)

#Dataset 1: tree level
##Starting object is the output of the seed load script
trees <- read_csv(here("./data/workflow/trees_sl.csv"))

#Dataset 2: transect level
tran <- read_csv(here("./data/cleaned/transect data_c.csv"))

#Dataset 3: site attributes
site <- read_csv(here("./data/workflow/site_metrics.csv"))

#Datasets 4: regen size and composition summary
reg_cs <- read_csv(here("./tables/reg_comp_size.csv"))

#Dataset 5: mature component infection summary
##NOTE: this table not longer exists. When you clean up this script dead with
##this
# mat_inf <- read_csv(here("./tables/mat_infection.csv"))

#Dataset 6: crown volume estimates
#These contain height estimates for the codominant mature and regen trees in
#each site
cv <- read_csv(here("./data/workflow/crown_vol.csv"))

#Dataset 7: vri polygons covering hdm sites
vri <- read_csv(here("./data/cleaned/vri_c.csv"))

#Dataset 8: climate
clim <- read_csv(here("./tables/site_climphys_big.csv"))

#Dataset 9: residual trees
resid <- read_csv(here("./data/raw/residual reference tree data.csv"))
```

##Pull varaibles from each dataset
Start assembling a modelling dataset by selecting variables from the tree level
dataframe. 
```{r}
#Look at what is in the the tree level dataset
str(trees)

#Pull out a subset for modelling
modelling <- trees %>% 
  select(tree_id, 
         site_id, 
         plot_id,
         dist_y_h,
         sim_tree,
         tree_type,
         tree_type_2,
         spp,
         status,
         dbh,
         crown_class,
         crown_class_2,
         CV,
         hdm_pa,
         b_lc,
         dmr_l,
         dmr_m,
         dmr_u,
         dmr, 
         dmr_f,
         broom_pa,
         broom_pos,
         stem_pa,
         sp, 
         sl_ni_rm,
         sl_i_tot_rm)
```

Move up one level and pull out slope from transect level dataframe. 
```{r}
#Pull out slope from transect dataset
#Inspect slope variables
str(tran)

#Transect slope is held in three columns. When the slope in a transect changes 
#along its length, it is recorded in multiple segments. Each new segment is 
#recorded in a separate column. 
#Calculate weighted average. Each slope value weighted by the proportion of
#the transect it represents. 
tran <- tran %>% 
  mutate(slope_wa  = case_when(
    !is.na(tr_sl3) ~ 
      (tr_sl1*(tr_dist1) + tr_sl2*(tr_dist2-tr_dist1) + 
         tr_sl3*(tr_dist3-tr_dist2))/(tr_leng),
    !is.na(tr_sl2) & is.na(tr_sl3) ~ 
      (tr_sl1*(tr_dist1) + tr_sl2*(tr_dist2-tr_dist1))/(tr_leng),
    !is.na(tr_sl1) & is.na(tr_sl2) & is.na(tr_sl3) ~
      (tr_sl1*(tr_dist1))/(tr_leng)))

#Join it to the modelling dataset
modelling <- left_join(modelling, select(tran, transect_id, slope_wa),
                       by = join_by(plot_id == transect_id))
```

Move up to the site level and pull out variables
```{r}
#Rename column that contains years since haravest
site <- site %>% 
  rename(yr_since_har = age)

#Pull out needed variables from the site level dataset
str(site)
x <- site %>% 
  select(site_id, 
         cluster, 
         elevation,
         bec,
         yr_since_har)

#Join this to the modelling dataframe
modelling <- left_join(modelling, x, by = "site_id")

#Pull out regen composition and size variables
x <- reg_cs %>% 
  select(site_id, reg.nstem_ha, reg.ba_m2_ha, reg.p_stem_hw)
str(reg_cs)
#Join this to the site level dataframe
modelling <- left_join(modelling, x, by = "site_id")
```

Get mature forest age estimates from vri dataset
```{r}
#Check what is in the vri dataset
str(vri)

#Filter to polygons representing mature trees
vri_m <- vri %>% filter(tree_type == "mature")

#Some sites are represented by multiple polygons. Average these: 
vri_m <- vri_m %>% 
  group_by(site_id) %>% 
  summarise(AGE_HW = mean(AGE_HW, na.rm = T))

#Join this to the modelling dataset
modelling <- left_join(modelling, vri_m, by = "site_id")
```

Join climate variables and also, run a PCA to see if that is a good way of
explaining the variation.
```{r}
#Subset climate dataframe to just the climate variables:
clim_pca <- clim %>% 
  select(MAT:Tmin_as)

#Check for infinite values
sum(is.infinite(as.matrix(clim_pca)))
#Check for missing values
sum(is.na(as.matrix(clim_pca)))

#Run the pca
#prcomp() function uses singular value decomposition
#because scale. = TRUE, this is will produce a correlation biplot
pca_clim <- prcomp(clim_pca, center = TRUE, scale. = TRUE)
?prcomp

#Inspect the pca object
pca_clim$sdev #the Eigenvalues (=proportional to the percent of variation explained)
head(pca_clim$x) #the actual scores for each site on the each axis
summary(pca_clim) #summary of the percent of variation explained by each axis

#Create a scree plot = shows how much variation is explained by each axis
scree.data <- tibble(axis = as.integer(1:length(pca_clim$sdev)), 
                     ev = pca_clim$sdev) %>% 
  mutate(var = ev^2) %>% mutate(tot_var = sum(var)) %>% 
  mutate(prop_ex = var/tot_var)
ggplot(scree.data, aes(x= axis, y=prop_ex)) + geom_col() + 
  geom_point(col="lightblue") +
  geom_line(col="lightblue") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 11, by =1)) +
  theme_classic()
#axis one and two explain 78% of the variation cumulatively

#Add the scores back to the initial dataframe
clim <- clim %>% bind_cols(pca_clim$x)

#Plot the first two PCA axes
#Color by BEC; label by site_id
#Looks like bec is a pretty good proxy for PC1 but not for PC2
ggplot(clim, aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, color = bec, label = site_id)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_text()

#Plot a covariance biplot to see which variables are driving each axes
#See Section 12.5 of Zuur et al (2007) for comparison of correlation
#vs distance biplot
ggbiplot(pca_clim, scale = 1, varname.color = "brown", varname.size = 2)
#Axis 1: differentiate sites along a growing season axis (summer temps, 
#precipitation)
#Axis 2: differentiates sites along a winter axis (winter temps, precipitation
#as snow)

#Pull out variables from climate dataframe.
str(clim)
x <- clim %>% select(site_id, MAT:Tmin_as, PC1:PC2)

#Join this to the modelling dataframe
modelling <- left_join(modelling, x, by = "site_id")
```

The tree level seed load variable has been challenging to use in these models 
because it is colinear with distance from the edge. So as alternative to try 
out, include some proxies for the inoculum load in the mature component at the
site level. Include two proxies here: seed production and basal area of 
infected trees. We would expect seed production to perform better because it
incorporates infection severity but it doesn't hurt to test both. 
```{r}
#Filter tree dataset to mature trees within 10m of the edge
mat <- trees %>% filter(tree_type == "mature" & (outside_10 == "N" |
                                                   is.na(outside_10)))

#Filter those to trees with seed production estimates
sp <- mat %>% 
  filter(!is.na(sp))

#Summarize at the site level
sp_s <- sp %>% 
  group_by(site_id) %>% 
  summarise(sp = sum(sp))

#Take a look at this. Looks about right. 
head(sp_s)

#Join this to the modelling dataframe
modelling <- left_join(modelling, sp_s, by = "site_id")

##BROKEN
#Pull basal area of infected mature trees from the dataframe summarizing 
#mature tree infection
# summary(mat_inf)
# 
# #Join this to the modelling dataframe
# x <- mat_inf %>% 
#   select(site_id, mat.hw_inf_ba_m2_ha)
# modelling <- left_join(modelling, x, by = "site_id")
```

Calculate height difference between mature and regen components. These 
estimates are in the crown volume dataset. 
```{r}
str(cv)

#Filter to co dominant/dominant layer
unique(cv$crown_class_2)
ht_diff <- cv %>% 
  filter(crown_class_2 == "C")

#Select just the relevant columns
ht_diff <- ht_diff %>% 
  select(site_id, tree_type, height_cv_est)

ht_diff <- pivot_wider(ht_diff, names_from = tree_type, 
                       values_from = height_cv_est)

ht_diff <- ht_diff %>% 
  mutate(ht_diff = mature - regen)
```

##Format and filter to final dataset
Finished assembling all of the variables. Next we need to filter the dataset 
to the population we want to model - live Hw regen trees within 50m of the 
edge. We are going to remove any putative residual trees from this set.
```{r}
#Filter to trees within 50m of the edge. This removes only a few trees at the
#cr_3 site
nrow(modelling)
modelling <- modelling %>% 
  filter(dist_y_h <= 50)
nrow(modelling)

#Filter to the live, regen, Hw trees
modelling <- modelling %>% 
  filter(tree_type == "regen" &
           status %in% c("LS", "LL", "LF") &
           spp == "Hw")
nrow(modelling) #1098 observations
```

When we measured sites, we identified potential residual trees. Some of those 
are included on the transects. Need to decide what to do with these. 
```{r}
#Dataset contains data for residual trees and reference trees (trees where we 
#took a reference tree core)
#How many residual trees are there? 
resid <- resid %>% filter(tree_type == "residual")
nrow(resid) #10

#How many are on a regen transect?
resid %>% filter(!is.na(regen_tree_id)) %>% nrow() #5

#Lets remove these from the modelling dataset
resid_rm <- resid %>% filter(!is.na(regen_tree_id)) %>% 
  pull(regen_tree_id)

#Add column to modelling dataset that identifies which trees are residuals
modelling <- modelling %>% 
  mutate(resid = if_else(tree_id %in% resid_rm, "Y", "N"))
modelling %>% select(resid) %>% table()

#Filter out residual trees
modelling <- modelling %>% filter(resid == "N")
nrow(modelling) #1093 observations
```

Reformat variables where needed. 
```{r}
#Insepct variables
str(modelling)

#Make factor variables factors
modelling <- modelling %>% 
  mutate(across(c(site_id, 
                  sim_tree,
                  tree_type,
                  tree_type_2,
                  spp,
                  hdm_pa,
                  b_lc,
                  dmr_f,

                  stem_pa,
                  cluster, 
                  bec), ~as.factor(.)))

#Response variable is dmr, an ordinal variable. Inspect it
#Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and IBLC are represented
#Recode factor to just these levels
modelling %>% select(dmr_f) %>% 
  table()
modelling <- modelling %>% 
  mutate(dmr_f = as.character(dmr_f)) %>% 
  mutate(dmr_f = factor(dmr_f, levels = c("0", "IBLC", "1", "2", "3",
                                          "4", "5")))

#See how many trees there are in each dmr class: 
#Inspect again
modelling %>% select(dmr_f) %>% 
  table()

#Initial models aren't converging. Collapsing dmr has helped resolve
#the issue. Define three new response variables to try, one with 6 levels, one
#with 4 and one with 3 that will be used in modelling. 
modelling <- modelling %>% 
  mutate(dmr_f_2 = case_when(dmr_f %in% c("4", "5") ~ "4-5",
                             .default = dmr_f),

                             .default = dmr_f)) %>% 
  mutate(dmr_f_2 = factor(dmr_f_2, levels = c("0", "IBLC", "1", "2", 
                                              "3", "4-5")),
         dmr_f_3 = factor(dmr_f_3, levels = c("0", "IBLC", "1-2", 
                                              "3-5")),
         dmr_f_4 = factor(dmr_f_4, levels = c("0", "IBLC-2", 
                                              "3-5")))

#Check these:
levels(modelling$dmr_f_2)
modelling %>% select(dmr_f_2) %>% 
  table()

levels(modelling$dmr_f_3)
modelling %>% select(dmr_f_3) %>% 
  table()

levels(modelling$dmr_f_4)
modelling %>% select(dmr_f_4) %>% 
  table()

#Redefine crown class variables so the are in logical order:
modelling <- modelling %>% 
  mutate(crown_class = 
           factor(crown_class, levels = c("S", "I", "C", "D")),
         crown_class_2 = 
           factor(crown_class_2, levels = c("S", "I", "C")))
levels(modelling$crown_class)
levels(modelling$crown_class_2)

#See how many trees there are in each crown class
modelling %>% select(crown_class) %>% 
  table()

#Distance from the edge likely has an exponential decay shape. Try adding 
#distance^2 and distance^4 as predictors
modelling <- modelling %>% 
  mutate(dist_y_h.2 = dist_y_h^2,
         dist_y_h.4 = dist_y_h^4)

#All looks good.
```

##Define some colours to plot with
```{r}
#DMR 7 levels
levels(modelling$dmr_f)
col_dmr_7 <- c("#A6CEE3", brewer.pal(n = 6, name = "Oranges"))

#DMR 3 levels
levels(modelling$dmr_f_4)
col_dmr3 <- c("#A6CEE3", "#FDBE85", "#A63603")
```

#Functions for each step of the modelling process
##Model building. 
-Need likelihood ratio tests to compare models (=test the 
significance of variables by comparing models that differ by one variable)
```{r}
#anova() {stats package}, performs the appropriate test (LR or F-test) 
#comparing two models
?anova()

#drop1() {stats package}, given a model (e.g. y ~ x1 + x2 + x3), drops each
#predictor (x1, x2, x3) from a model and compares that to the full model where
#no variables are dropped. If only wanting to test specific terms, can 
#specify those with the scope argument. 
?drop1()
```

##Assessing goodness of fit
There are three statistics that test for goodness of fit. Reference: Fagerland 
and Hosmer (2013). 
- Lipsitz test
- Hosmer-Lemeshow test
- Pulkstenis-Robinson test
```{r}
#All three test statistics are in the generalhoslem package
?generalhoslem

#Lipsitz test
?lipsitz.test()

#Hosmer-Lemeshow test
#Seems like the most general one. Less power than Lipsitz and 
#Pulkstenis-Robinson but can detect more types of lack of fit.
?logitgof()

#Pulkstenis-Robinson tests
#Two tests, on that is an extension of the Chi-squared test statistic and
#another that is a decivance test statistic. Both follow a chi-squared 
#distribution
?pulkrob.chisq()
?pulkrob.deviance()
```

##Assessing discriminatory power of the models
There are four tools available for testing the discriminatory power of the 
models: 
- Classification tables. These have the obvious weakness of relying on some
arbitrary way of assigning an observation with probabilities for each
level of the response (DMR) to one level. We will probably use the level with
the highest probability. 
- Weighted kappa. 
- ROC curve. Can plot one of these for each of the logit models (J-1 of them). 
But should be the same for all of them if the proportional odds assumption is
met. 
- Visual plots. These plot observed DMR against estimated probability. Will 
have one plot for each level of DMR. 
```{r}
#Weighted kappa. From {vcd} package (Visualizng Categorical Data)
?Kappa()
```

#Demonstration model
Start with a simple one to explore what these models look like

##Model specification
Standard model specification.
```{r}
# #Centre seed load and refit model
# modelling <- modelling %>% 
#   mutate(sl_c = sl_i_tot_rm - (mean(sl_i_tot_rm)))
# summary(modelling$sl_c)
# 
# #Model: dmr ~ seed load (including interception)
# d1 <- clm(dmr_f_2 ~ sl_c, data=modelling, link = "logit")
# 
# #Model: dmr ~ seed load (including interception) with site random effect
# d2 <- clmm(dmr_f_2 ~ sl_i_tot_rm + (1|site_id), 
#            data = modelling,
#            link = "logit")
```

##What is in the summary output?
- Coefficient associated with the predictor (seed load == sl_i_tot_rm). This is
the log odds value change in dmr_f corresponding to a one unit increase in 
seed load. Or rather, for every one unit increase in seed load, the likelihood
of a dmr_f = 4, versus dmr_f = 1-3, increases by 0.0130 on a log odds scale. 
Because of the central assumption of ordinal regression modelling that the 
jump between any two J has the same probability, this also means that the 
likelihood of dmr_f = "anything" versus a dmr_f = anything-1, increases by 
0.0130 on a log odds scale. 
- "Threshold coefficients" are the intercepts for each of the logit functions
fitted by the model. 
-These two things (a slope and the intercept) can be used to estimate the 
response. This estimation can be done in terms of log odds or odds (e.g. 
how much do the odds of level j vs levels j-1 change for a 1 unit increase
in the predictors), in terms of odds ratios (e.g. how much do the odds of a 
a given level change between x1 and x2) and in terms of probabilities. 
```{r}
# #Model: dmr ~ seed load (including interception)
# summary(d1)
# 
# #Model: dmr ~ seed load (including interception) with site random effect
# summary(d2)
# 
# #Check convergence:
# convergence(d1)
# 
# #Example: look at odds of dmr_f = 0 vs IBLC, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 for seed load
# #values of 100, 200 and 300
# #Decreases, which makes sense. dmr_f = 0 most likely at low seed load value
# o_100 <- exp(d1$alpha[1] - d1$beta[1]*100)
# o_200 <- exp(d1$alpha[1] - d1$beta[1]*200)
# o_300 <- exp(d1$alpha[1] - d1$beta[1]*300)
# o_100; o_200; o_300
# 
# #Express these as probabilities. plogis function does the conversion of the
# #log odds to probabilities.
# lo_100 <- d1$alpha[1] - d1$beta[1]*100
# lo_200 <- d1$alpha[1] - d1$beta[1]*200
# lo_300 <- d1$alpha[1] - d1$beta[1]*300
# plogis(lo_100) 
# plogis(lo_200)
# plogis(lo_300)
# 
# #Use the ggeffects package to get predictions for many more variables
# ##This generates a dataframe with levels of a predictor (in this case 
# ##seed load, broken into intervals of 50) and the probability of each dmr_f
# ##level. 
# ##Each predictor-response level is its own row 
# ##The "terms" term specifies which variables you are intersted in predicted
# ##values for 
# ##The margin term specifies how to treat variables that aren't of interest

###Construct a table for thesis
Going to recreate the table above but with a bit more detail. Goal is to 
summarize the modelling dataset that went into my thesis. 

Rows:
- all trees
- DMR

Columns: 
- total sample size
- sample size of measured trees
- sample size of simulated trees
- distance from the edge
- seed load
- dbh

Start by summarizing these variables across all trees
```{r}
tb2 <- modelling %>% 
  summarise(n_tot = n(),
            n_meas = sum(sim_tree == "N"),
            n_sim = sum(sim_tree == "Y"),
            dist_mean = mean(dist_y_h),
            dist_min = min(dist_y_h),
            dist_max = max(dist_y_h),
            sl_mean = mean(sl_i_tot_rm),
            sl_min = min(sl_i_tot_rm),
            sl_max = max(sl_i_tot_rm),
            dbh_mean = mean(dbh),
            dbh_min = min(dbh),
            dbh_max = max(dbh))

#Add a column at the front specifying the group
tb2 <- tb2 %>% 
  mutate(group = "All")
```

Then summarize these variables across dmr classes
```{r}
tb3 <- modelling %>%
  select(dmr_f, sim_tree, dist_y_h, sl_i_tot_rm, dbh) %>% 
  group_by(dmr_f) %>% 
  summarise(n_tot = n(),
            n_meas = sum(sim_tree == "N"),
            n_sim = sum(sim_tree == "Y"),
            dist_mean = mean(dist_y_h),
            dist_min = min(dist_y_h),
            dist_max = max(dist_y_h),
            sl_mean = mean(sl_i_tot_rm),
            sl_min = min(sl_i_tot_rm),
            sl_max = max(sl_i_tot_rm),
            dbh_mean = mean(dbh),
            dbh_min = min(dbh),
            dbh_max = max(dbh)) %>% 
  rename(group = dmr_f)

#Combine these tables
tb3 <- rbind(tb2, tb3)
```

Export final table
```{r}
# write_csv(tb3, here("./tables/model_dtset_sum.csv"))
```

##Plot dmr against tree level predictors
Start witth plotting it against continuous predictors
```{r}
#DISTANCE FROM THE EDGE
#Boxplot comparing dmr to distance from the edge

                                  face = "bold"))
dmr_pred2

#DBH
#Boxplot comparing dmr to tree dbh
dmr_pred3 <- ggplot(modelling, aes(x = dbh, 
                      y = dmr_f)) +

                                  face = "bold"))

```

Then plot it against crown class
```{r}
#Find # trees in each DMR class within each crown class

#Join these tables, then calculate the percent of trees in each dmr class 
#within each crown class
x <- left_join(x, x1, by = "crown_class")
x <- x %>% 
  mutate(p_trees = 100*n_trees/tot_trees)

#Check these sum to 100
x %>% group_by(crown_class) %>% summarise(sum(p_trees))

#Add fake values to the x1 dataframe so it can be added to the plot to show the
#total sample size in each crown class
x1 <- x1 %>% 
  mutate(p_trees = 105,
         dmr_f = NA)

#Plot this: 
dmr_pred4 <- ggplot(x, aes(x = crown_class, y = p_trees, fill = dmr_f)) + 
  geom_bar(position = position_stack(reverse =  TRUE), stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = col_dmr_7, 
                    na.translate = FALSE, 
                    guide = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE)) + 
  geom_text(data = x1, aes(x=crown_class, 
                           y = p_trees, 
                           label = tot_trees),
            family = "Times New Roman",

```

###Compile plot for thesis
```{r}

##Pairs plot
Generate pairs plot to see multicolinearity between tree level predictors. As 
expected, multicolinearity occurs between: 
- seed load and distance from the edge
- dbh and crown class
```{r}
#Subset dataframe to just the tree level predictors
x <- modelling %>% 
  select(sl_i_tot_rm, dist_y_h, dbh, crown_class)

#Transform distance from the edge to make correlation between seed load and 
#distance from the edge clear
x <- x %>% 
  mutate(dist_y_h_4 = dist_y_h^(1/4))

#Generate the plot. Uses ggpairs() fucntion from {GGally} package
##Diagonal shows the density (continuous vars) or a historgram (categorical 
##vars)
##Lower off diagonal shows a scatter plot for two continuous variables or a 
##histogram for each category of categorical variable for continuous x 
##categorical combinations. 
##Upper off diagonal shows a scatterplot for two either Pearson's correlation 
##coefficient (two continuous vars) or a boxplot for continuousx categorical 
##combinations
ggpairs(x)
```

###Pairs plot for thesis
Make a simple pairs plot to include in thesis

##Track likelihood, AIC and LR tests
Create dataframes to track model fitting. One dataframe that likelihood and 
AIC and one that has likelihood ratio tests comparing two models. 
```{r}
tb_mfit <- data.frame("Model" = NA, "logLikelihood" = NA, "AIC" = NA)

##Null Model
Fit the null model. Use DMR collapsed to three levels. Has good 
interpratability and increases sample size in rarely represented categories. 
```{r}

##Two variable models
All tree level predictors are significant but need to assess colinearity. 
Build model with three terms: distance, seed load and dbh. Look at standard 
error estimates of the coefficients. Do they become inflated when distance and
seed load are included?

Start with a two variable model: distance and dbh
```{r}
#Model 8
##Predictor: distance from the edge and dbh
##Interpretation: both are significant, standard errors are reasonable
m8 <- clm(dmr_f_4 ~ dist_y_h + dbh, 
           data = modelling,
           link = "logit",
           threshold = "flexible")
summary(m8)

#Use likelihood ratio tests to test if these are significantly better than the
#univariate models
#Both support the model with both variables
lr8_2 <- anova(m2, m8)
lr8_2
lr8_6 <- anova(m6, m8)
lr8_6

#Use AIC to compare model fit of model with both variables to univariate models
AIC(m2); AIC(m6); AIC(m8)
```

Now test second possible two variable model: distance and seed load.
```{r}
#Model 9
##Predictor: distance from the edge and seed load
##Interpretation: both are significant, standard errors are reasonable, maybe
##slightly large for seed load
m9 <- clm(dmr_f_4 ~ dist_y_h + sl_i_tot_rm, 
           data = modelling,

##Second order interactions
Now test for second order interactions. Three to test: distance x seed load, 
distance x dbh and seed load x dbh. Start with distance x seed load. 
```{r}
#Model 12
##Predictor: distance from the edge, seed load, dbh and distance x seedload
##interaction
##Interpretation: interaction significant and seed load becomes insignificant.
##Standard errors are reasonable. 
m12 <- clm(dmr_f_4 ~ dist_y_h*sl_i_tot_rm + dbh, 
           data = modelling,
           link = "logit",
           threshold = "flexible")
summary(m12)

#Use LR test to test whether interaction term is significant
##Interpretation: significant
lr12_11 <- anova(m11, m12)
lr12_11

#Compare AIC of two models
##Reasonably large AIC reduction (~25)
AIC(m11); AIC(m12)
```

Now test distance x dbh interaction
```{r}
#Model 13
##Predictor: distance from the edge, seed load, dbh and distance x dbh
##interaction
##Interpretation: interaction significant, standard errors reasonable
m13 <- clm(dmr_f_4 ~ dist_y_h*dbh + sl_i_tot_rm, 
           data = modelling,
           link = "logit",
           threshold = "flexible")
summary(m13)

#Use LR test to test whether interaction term is significant. Also look at AICs
##Interpretation: interaction significant and small reduction in AIC (~7)
lr13_11 <- anova(m11, m13)
lr13_11
```

Finally, test seed load x dbh interaction
```{r}
#Model 14
##Predictor: distance from the edge, seed load, dbh and seed load x dbh
##interaction
##Interpretation: interaction significant, but effect is relatively small and
##model is "nearly unidentifiable". Seed load becomes insignificant. 
m14 <- clm(dmr_f_4 ~ dist_y_h + dbh*sl_i_tot_rm, 
           data = modelling,
           link = "logit",

lr14_11

#Compare AICs of model without interaction and those with one second order 
#interaction
AIC(m11); AIC(m12); AIC(m13); AIC(m14)
```

Compile model fit and lr tests again
```{r}

mod <- c("m12", "m13", "m14")
ll <- c(m12$logLik, m13$logLik, m14$logLik)

df <- data.frame("Model" = mod, "logLikelihood" = ll, "AIC" = aic)
tb_mfit <- rbind(tb_mfit, df)

#LR tests

comp <- c("m12-m11", "m13-m11", "m14-m11")
dAIC <- aic - AIC(m11)
lrstat <- c(lr12_11$LR.stat[2], lr13_11$LR.stat[2], lr14_11$LR.stat[2])
df <- rep(1, 3)
p <- c(lr12_11$`Pr(>Chisq)`[2], lr13_11$`Pr(>Chisq)`[2],

                 "LR.stat" = lrstat,  "df" = df, "p" = p)
tb_lr <- rbind(tb_lr, df)
```

Okay, seems like all three interaction terms are significant. Build all three 
models with two interactions and compare AICs. 
```{r}
#Model 15
##Predictor: distance from the edge, seed load, dbh, distance x seed load int
##and seed load x dbh interaction
m15 <- clm(dmr_f_4 ~ dist_y_h + dbh + sl_i_tot_rm +

lr15_12 <- anova(m15, m12)
lr15_12
lr15_14 <- anova(m15, m14)
lr15_14

#Model 16

##and distance x dbh interaction
m16 <- clm(dmr_f_4 ~ dist_y_h + dbh + sl_i_tot_rm + 
             dist_y_h:sl_i_tot_rm + dist_y_h:dbh, 
           data = modelling,
           link = "logit",
           threshold = "flexible")
summary(m16)
lr16_13 <- anova(m16, m13)
lr16_13

lr16_12

#Model 17
##Predictor: distance from the edge, seed load, dbh, seed load int x dbh
##and distance x dbh interaction
m17 <- clm(dmr_f_4 ~ dist_y_h + dbh + sl_i_tot_rm + 
             sl_i_tot_rm:dbh + dist_y_h:dbh, 
           data = modelling,
           link = "logit",
           threshold = "flexible")

lr17_13 <- anova(m17, m13)
lr17_13
lr17_14 <- anova(m17, m14)
lr17_14
```

Also build a model with all three interactions. 
```{r}
#Model 18
##Predictor: distance from the edge, seed load, dbh and all second order
##interactions
##Interpretation: distance x dbh interaction become non-significant model 
##converges but is nearly unidentifiable
m18 <- clm(dmr_f_4 ~ dist_y_h + dbh + sl_i_tot_rm + 
             dist_y_h:dbh + dist_y_h:sl_i_tot_rm + sl_i_tot_rm:dbh, 
           data = modelling,
           link = "logit",
           threshold = "flexible")
summary(m18)
lr18_15 <- anova(m18, m15)

lr18_16 <- anova(m18, m16)
lr18_16
lr18_17 <- anova(m18, m17)
lr18_17
```

Compare AICs.
```{r}
#Make some AIC comparisons. Models 12, 13 and 14 have one second order 
#interaction. Models 15, 16 and 17 have two. Model 18 has all three. 
##Interpretation: Model 15 (seed load x distance and seed load x dbh 
##interactions) performs best. Go with this one. 
AIC(m12); AIC(m13); AIC(m14); AIC(m15); AIC(m16); AIC(m17); AIC(m18)

                 "LR.stat" = lrstat,  "df" = df, "p" = p)
tb_lr <- rbind(tb_lr, df)
```

##Random effect
Okay we now have a working model with 5 terms, its complex. Is it possible to
add a random effect to this model? 
```{r}
#Refit model 
#Model 19
##Predictor: distance from the edge, seed load, dbh, distance x seed load int
##and seed load x dbh interaction
##Random effect: site
##Interpretation: get warning messages
m19 <- clmm(dmr_f_4 ~ dist_y_h + dbh + sl_i_tot_rm + 
             dist_y_h:sl_i_tot_rm + sl_i_tot_rm:dbh + (1|site_id), 
           data = modelling,
           link = "logit",
           threshold = "flexible")
summary(m19)
lr19_15 <- anova(m19, m15)
lr19_15
```

This will make interpreting the variables harder, but try rescaling the 
variables. 
```{r}
modelling <- modelling %>% 
  mutate(dist_y_h.s = as.numeric(scale(dist_y_h)),
         dbh.s = as.numeric(scale(dbh)),
         sl_i_tot_rm.s = as.numeric(scale(sl_i_tot_rm)))

#Model 20
##Same as Model 19 but with variables scaled. 
##Predictor: distance from the edge, seed load, dbh, distance x seed load int
##and seed load x dbh interaction
##Random effect: site
##Interpretation: no warning messages all variables significant
m20 <- clmm(dmr_f_4 ~ dist_y_h.s + dbh.s + sl_i_tot_rm.s + 
             dist_y_h.s:sl_i_tot_rm.s + sl_i_tot_rm.s:dbh.s + (1|site_id), 
           data = modelling,
           link = "logit",
           threshold = "flexible")
summary(m20)

#Compare AIC of this model against the one where the variables are not scaled. 
#There should be NO DIFFERENCE. We haven't added any information to the model
#we have just eased made it easier for the model to get to a ML solution.
AIC(m19); AIC(m20)
```

Compile model fit and LR test info
```{r}
#Model fit
names(tb_mfit)
mod <- c("m19", "m20")
ll <- c(m19$logLik, m20$logLik)
aic <- c(AIC(m19), AIC(m20))
df <- data.frame("Model" = mod, "logLikelihood" = ll, "AIC" = aic)
tb_mfit <- rbind(tb_mfit, df)

#LR tests
names(tb_lr)
comp <- c("m19-m15")
dAIC <- c(AIC(m19)-AIC(m15))
lrstat <- c(lr19_15$LR.stat[2])
df <- 1
p <- c(lr19_15$`Pr(>Chisq)`[2])
df <- data.frame("Comparison" = comp, "dAIC" = dAIC,
                 "LR.stat" = lrstat,  "df" = df, "p" = p)
tb_lr <- rbind(tb_lr, df)
```

##Proportional odds assumption
Okay, this is a good working model. We need to test the proportional odds
assumption for each of the five variables. 

The goal is to compare predictions from models where parameter estimates are 
unique for each logit (partial proportional odds) to those where they are the 
same for all logits (proportional odds). For reference, if there are j levels 
in the response, j-1 logits (which are sort of like submodels) are fit in an 
ordinal model. Each logit predicts the cumulative logit odds of P<= j. In the 
proportional odds version, we assume the effect of each predictor is the same 
across all logits, which is the same as saying across all j. In the partial 
proportional odds models, a unique coefficient is fit for each logit for each 
predictor that is allowed to vary (allowed to have nominal effects). In 
practice, this means that the probability of transitioning between two levels 
of j, depends on j (e.g. the coefficient that predicts the cumulative odds 
relating DMR = 0 to DMR = IBLC-2 is significantly different from the one that
relates DMR = IBLC-2 to DMR = 3-5). 

###Statistical tests of assumption
One predictor at a time we will fit a partial proportional odds model that 
allows it to vary and holds the other predictors to the proportional odds 
assumption. In the oridnal package this is called allowing the variable to have
nominal effects. We will test the significance of the additional parameters 
with likelihood ratio tests comparing against model 20 that restricts all of 
the predictors to proportional odds. In our case just one more parameter is
needed - response (DMR) has 3 levels, so 2 logits are fit in nominal effects 
model, each with a distinct parameter estimate. 

Start with the distance from the edge
```{r}
#Model 21
##Same as Model 20 but fit with clmm2, which allows for nominal effects

m21 <- clmm2(dmr_f_4 ~ dist_y_h.s + dbh.s + sl_i_tot_rm.s +

###Graphical tests of assumption
In the tests, only distance from the edge failed to meet the proportional 
odds assumption. Biljana Stojkova from the Stats group suggested also assessing
this assumption graphically. There is a good tutorial on the general approach
to this from UCLA here: https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/r/dae/ordinal-logistic-regression/

That tutorial fits single variable separate logit models outside of a larger
proportional odds model for each variable. i.e. a model is fit for P<= 0
and for P<=IBLC-2. We will use the partial proportional odds models fit above
which do the same thing, just wrapped up in a single model. 

Plot 1
- Plot all logits from a model with nominal effects across the range of a focal 
predictor. Meeting the assumption means that the distance between any two 
logits on a graph (e.g. P <= 0 and P <= IBLC-2) should be the same across the 
range of a predictor.

Plot 2
- Plot of difference in predicted probabilities between model with nominal
effects and one with proportional odds. This tells you something about how 
much nominal effects (if present) affect the actual probabilities - if a 
partial proportional odds model is significantly different from a proporitonal
odds one, is it meaningful?

POINTS TO CLARIFY
Do the plotted logits in plot 1 need to be parallel LINEAR lines? I think yes.

##Final model
The proportional odds assumption seems met well enough for me for distance
from the edge. For the sake of interpretaability, lets stick with the simpler
model that assumes proportional odds. That means our working models is:
$$
\text{logit}\left(P(Y \leq j)\right) = \tau_j - \left( \beta_1 \cdot \text{dist_y_h.s} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{dbh.s} + \beta_3 \cdot \text{sl_i_tot_rm.s} + \beta_4 \cdot \text{dist_y_h.s} \times \text{sl_i_tot_rm.s} + \beta_5 \cdot \text{sl_i_tot_rm.s} \times \text{dbh.s} \right) + u_{\text{site_id}}
$$

#Understanding variable effects
The goal of this section is to understand how each predictor influences the 
response. The {ggeffects} package is designed for doing this and is used for 
most of the plots here. A predict() function isn't available for clmm objects
yet and that is required for the {ggeffects} options that allow summaries of
random effects; so the effect of random effects is done manually, following 
the tutorial on the {ordinal} package webpage. 

Four plots are created:
(1) The first one shows all variable combinations. It is complicated and got 
rejected as not that useful for a reader in the feedback from my committee. 
I've kept it here because it is a true representation of the model behaviour  
across all the variable combinations represented in the data. 

(2) The second uses  a single DBH value (the mean of dominant/codominant 
trees). These are the future crop trees and the goal of the figure is to show 
how the probability of infection changes with distance from the edge in a 
seed-load dependent way. 

(3) The third focuses on the effect of DBH. Two panels are created. One at a 
fixed distance (7.5 m from the edge), where DBH and seed load interact. The
second shows predicted probabilities from 20-50 m where, seed load = 0, for 
different DBH values; the goals of the second panel is to compare the effects
of DBH and distance. 

(4) Shows the magnitude of the random site effect. It generates probabilities 
for an average tree in an average, high infection and low infection site. 

##Plot 1
###Select meaningful values of predictors
The first step is to choose what values of each predictor we want to get 
predictions of the response at. These should be meaningful values, representing
the range, or some low, medium, high like scale. Also, only combinations of 
predictor variables that exist in the data (or are realistic) should appear in 
the final product. 

Two kinds of value sets are created for each predictor, one for when it is the 
focal predictor that has relatively more values and one or two for when it is 
secondary predictor, where it is used as grouping or faceting variable. 

The model is fit on scaled versions of the variables. So value sets are created
with logic about the variable on the original scale and then are transformed to
the scaled scale. 

Different options choosing and specifying values in {ggeffects} are described 
in this vignette: https://strengejacke.github.io/ggeffects/articles/introduction_effectsatvalues.html 
####Distance from the edge values
Distance from the edge is easy. For its set as a focal predictor, do 5m 
intervals. For its sets a secondary predictor do: 5, 25 and 45m for the dbh
plots and 2.5, 7.5 and 12.5m for the seed load plots
```{r}
#Generate vectors of distances
val_d1 <- seq(from = 0, to = 50, by = 5)
val_d2 <- c(5, 25, 45)
val_d3 <- c(2.5, 7.5, 12.5)

#Scale these values using mean and sd of distance from modelling dataset
dist_mean <- mean(modelling$dist_y_h)
dist_sd <- sd(modelling$dist_y_h)
val_d1 <- (val_d1 - dist_mean)/dist_sd
val_d2 <- (val_d2 - dist_mean)/dist_sd
val_d3 <- (val_d3 - dist_mean)/dist_sd

#Compare ranges to check this worked as expected. Look good.
val_d1
val_d2
val_d3
range(modelling$dist_y_h.s)
```

####Seed load values
Seed load is trickier. Its own frequency distribution is severely left skewed 
because it has so many zeros. And it is structurally related to distance from
the edge. It is only > 0 for distances < 20m. The model will generate estimates
for the whole distance range, but the combinations that are actually 
representative of the data are constrained. 

For its set as a focal predictor: generate a sequence of 50unit interval across
its range. For its set as a secondary predictor: select values 
corresponding to 0, a moderate value and a high value. 

With both of these, make sure to remove combinations from final plots that 
don't exist or are unrealistic in the data. 
```{r}
#Plot histogram of seed load
##Interpretation: set high value at 300 and moderate value at 100 for set when
##seed load is non-focal predictor
ggplot(modelling, aes(x = sl_i_tot_rm)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 50)

#Plot seed load against distance from the edge
##Interpretation: High values only exist at distances <10m and moderate values 
##at distances <15m. 
range(modelling$sl_i_tot_rm)
ggplot(modelling, aes(x = dist_y_h, y = sl_i_tot_rm)) + 
  geom_point()

#Plot DBH vs seed load
##Interpretation: high values ren't observed for trees with dbh > 
##25cm but there is no logical/ecological reason for this. I think its just
##chance. So get predictions for all combinations. 
ggplot(modelling, aes(x = dbh, y = sl_i_tot_rm)) + 
  geom_point()

#Generate vectors of values
range(modelling$sl_i_tot_rm)
val_sl1 <- seq(0, 550, by = 50)
val_sl2 <- c(0, 100, 300)

#Scale these to feed them into the model
sl_mean <- mean(modelling$sl_i_tot_rm)
sl_sd <- sd(modelling$sl_i_tot_rm)
val_sl1 <- (val_sl1 - sl_mean)/sl_sd
val_sl2 <- (val_sl2 - sl_mean)/sl_sd

#Compare ranges to check this worked as expected. Look good.
val_sl1
val_sl2
range(modelling$sl_i_tot_rm.s)
```

####DBH values
DBH has a fairly standard distribution. For its focal value set, can use one 
of the defaults in {ggeffects} which selects its min, max and quartiles. For 
when its a non-focal predictor, use the mean value of suppressed, 
intermediate and codominant trees. 
```{r}
#Plot a historgram of DBH
ggplot(modelling, aes(x=dbh)) + 
  geom_histogram()

#Generate vectors of values. Only need non-focal set because we can generate 
#focal set with built in defaults in {ggeffects}
val_dbh2 <- modelling %>% 
  group_by(crown_class_2) %>% 
  summarise(mean_dbh = mean(dbh)) %>% 
  pull(mean_dbh)

#Scale these to feed them into the model
dbh_mean <- mean(modelling$dbh)
dbh_sd <- sd(modelling$dbh)
val_dbh2 <- (val_dbh2 - dbh_mean)/dbh_sd

#Compare ranges to check this worked as expected. Look good.
val_dbh2
range(modelling$dbh.s)
```

###Generate predictions
Predictions are the probability of each DMR class at each unique combination of 
predictors. For each focal variable, we will get predictions across its full 
value range across each combination of the two non-focal predictors. In 
practice, this will result in three facet plot. The facet will capture the 
different levels in one of the non-focal predictors. Shape/line type will 
capture the different levels in the other non-focal predictor. Colour will 
differentiate the different DMR levels. All of these predictions are for the 
population average (i.e. assume random effect is 0).

####Distance from the edge predictions
Distance from the edge shows up in two places in the model - on its own and in
interaction with seed load. Because it doesn't interact with dbh, the pattern
should be the same across the three panels of dbh. But, dbh will change the 
where each DMR level is centred on the y axis. 
```{r}
#Focal predictor: distance from edge

pr1 <- pr1 %>% 
  mutate(group = as.character(group)) %>% 
  mutate(sl = case_match(group,
                         sl_lev[1] ~ "0",

####DBH predictions
DBH is similar to distance from the edge. It exists on its own and in an 
interaction with seed load in the model. Its pattern shouldn't change across 
panels of distance from the edge, but distance from the edge will change where 
the pattern is centered on the y axis. 
```{r}

####Seed load
Seed load is the hardest predictor to interpret. It appears in the model on its
own and in interactions with distance from the edge and dbh. Seed load is only
non-zero for distances < 25m so its only relevant to plot it for predictor 
combinations in that range. 
```{r}

###Combine plots for three predictor variables
Here, I'm considering each three panel plot for a predictor variable one plot. 
The plots share a DMR legend but have a distinct secondary aesthetic. Strategy:
make each plot a row, create a shared colour legend to put on top and have a 
distinct legend at the right of each plot. 
```{r}
#Save the DMR colour legend:
leg_dmr <- ggpubr::get_legend(
  ggplot(pr3, aes(x = sl, y = predicted, color = DMR)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line(linewidth = 2.5) +
  theme_classic() +
  scale_color_manual(values = col_dmr3) +
  theme(legend.position = "top",
        legend.background = element_rect(fill = "lightgrey"),
        legend.key = element_rect(fill = "lightgrey", color = NA),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 20),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 16)),
  position = "top")

#Recreate the plots but without the colour legend item and adding a 
#legend justification argument that ensures they are aligned in the combined 
#plot
g_pr1 <- g_pr1 + guides(color = "none") + 
  theme(legend.justification = c(0, 0.5))
g_pr2 <- g_pr2 + guides(color = "none") + 
  theme(legend.justification = c(0, 0.5))
g_pr3 <- g_pr3 + guides(color = "none") + 
  theme(legend.justification = c(0, 0.5))

#Combine the plots
g_pr4 <- plot_grid(g_pr1, g_pr2, g_pr3, 
          nrow = 3, ncol = 1,
          align = "hv",
          labels = "AUTO",
          label_size = 20,
          hjust = -0.8,
          vjust = -0.5)
g_pr4
?plot_grid

#Add the colour legend
g_pr5 <- plot_grid(leg_dmr, g_pr4, 
          nrow = 2, ncol = 1, rel_heights = c(1, 15))
g_pr5

#Export the graph
# pdf(here("./figures/var_effects.pdf"), width = 8.5, height = 11)
# g_pr5
# dev.off()
```

##Plot 2
Select some representative values for predictors
```{r}
#For distance from the edge go from 0-50m in 1m steps
#Generate vectors of distances
val_d4 <- seq(from = 0, to = 50, by = 1)
#Scale these values using mean and sd of distance from modelling dataset
val_d4 <- (val_d4 - dist_mean)/dist_sd

#For seed load, use the three values selected above, representing 0, low and
#high seed load
val_sl2 <- (val_sl2 - sl_mean)/sl_sd

#For dbh, use mean of dominant/codominant trees
val_dbh3 <- val_dbh2[3]
```

Generate predictions, then reformat the data frame for plotting
```{r}

##Plot 4: Random effects
Variation between sites is large in this dataset. Going to quantify it here by
estimating site effects and then plotting how the distance from edge effect 
changes with different site effects. I am roughly following this tutorial on 
the ordinal web page: https://rdrr.io/cran/ordinal/f/inst/doc/clmm2_tutorial.pdf 

Start by estimating the effect for each site. In the tutorial they note: "The 
judge effects, u(judgei) are not parameters, so they cannot be estimated in the 
conventional sense, but a “best guess” is provided by the conditional modes. 
Similarly the conditional variance provides an uncertainty measure of the 
conditional modes".
```{r}
#Extract random effects and conditional variance (estimate of variance around
#each random effect (= conditonal mode))
ran_ef <- tibble(ranef = m20$ranef, cond_var = m20$condVar, 
                 site = unique(modelling$site_id))

#Calculate confidence interval based on the conditional variance
ran_ef <- ran_ef %>% 
  mutate(ci = ranef + qnorm(0.975) * sqrt(cond_var) %o% c(-1, 1))

#Arrange from low to high for plotting
ran_ef <- ran_ef %>% arrange(ranef) %>% 
  mutate(site = factor(site, levels = unique(ran_ef$site)))

#Calculate extreme judge effects (used in the plot below too) and add them as
#horizontal lines in this plot
summary(m20)
#5th percentile
re_5p <- qnorm(0.95)*-1*1.986
#95th percentile
re_95p <- qnorm(0.95)*1*1.986

g_re1 <- ggplot(ran_ef, aes(x = site, y = ranef)) + 
  geom_point(color = "grey") + 
  geom_linerange(aes(ymin = ci[, 1], ymax = ci[, 2]), color = "grey") + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "grey", linetype = 1) +

        legend.title = element_text(size = 11, family = "Times New Roman",
                                  face = "bold"),
        plot.margin = unit(c(.5, 2, .5, .5), "cm"),) +
  labs(x = "Site",
       y = "Random effect estimate") +
  coord_cartesian(clip = "off")
g_re1

#Save this plot
# ggsave(here("./figures/ran_effect_est.svg"), plot = g_re1, device = "svg",
#         width = 5, height = 3, units = "in")
```

The next step is more complex because {ggeffects} and {ordinal} don't work 
together yet to get predictions under differ random effects. So need to 
calculate predictions manually. Use the distance from the edge effect as the 
example because that is most intuitive. The general steps were: create a
dataset where distance from the edge varies (0-50), seed load is set at its
mean and dbh is set at the mean for dominant/codominant trees; scale so they 
match the model inputs; estimate the average (random effect = 0) and extreme 
(random effect = 95% CI limits) random effects; manually calcualte 
probabilities of each response; then plot. 
```{r}
#Generate a data set with the three predictors
##Distance from the edge varies, seed load and dbh are at their mean
dbh_cd <- modelling %>% 
  filter(crown_class_2 == "C") %>% 
  summarise(dbh = mean(dbh)) %>% 
  pull(dbh)
ran_ef2 <- data.frame(dist_y_h = rep(seq(0, 50, 5), 3),
                      dbh = rep(dbh_cd, 33),
                      sl_i_tot_rm = rep(sl_mean, 33))

#Scale the predictors

##Goodness of fit tests

#Plot these
#Notice that the probability of DMR 3-5 is left skewed. Lots of prob = 0.

##Testing different link functions
Conceptually, the one that seems most 
appropriate is the complementary log-log, but others symmetric links (logit, 
probit, etc) could work just fine too.
```{r}
#Model 13
##Predictor: distance from the edge and dbh
##Random effect: site
##Link: complementary log likelihood
##Get a warning message here. 
m13 <- clmm(dmr_f_4 ~ dist_y_h + dbh + (1|site_id), 
           data = modelling,
           link = "cloglog",
           threshold = "flexible")
summary(m13)

#Model 14
##Predictor: distance from the edge and dbh
##Random effect: site
##Link: probit
##Get a warning message here. 
m14 <- clmm(dmr_f_4 ~ dist_y_h + dbh + (1|site_id), 
           data = modelling,
           link = "probit",
           threshold = "flexible")
summary(m14)

#Compare log likelihoods and AIC of the different links
m12$logLik; m13$logLik; m14$logLik #logit and probit provide best fits
AIC(m12); AIC(m13); AIC(m14) #logit and probit provide best fits 
```

##Nominal and scale effects
Test the proportional odds assumption. To do this, we fit models that allow for
nominal effects and then compare it to one without using with a likelihood 
ratio test. Nominal effects haven't been integrates into clmm yet, but they are
in the legacy function clmm2. 
```{r}
#Refit Model 12 (dmr ~ distance + dbh) with clmm2
m15 <- clmm2(dmr_f_4 ~ dist_y_h + dbh, random = site_id, data = modelling,
            link = "logistic", threshold = "flexible", Hess = TRUE)
summary(m15)

#Fit models that allow for nominal effects in distance and dbh

#Model 16
##Predictor: distance from the edge and dbh
##Nominal: distance from the edge
##Random effect: site

m16 <- clmm2(dmr_f_4 ~ dbh, nominal = ~dist_y_h, random = site_id, 
             data = modelling, link = "logistic", threshold = "flexible", 
             Hess = TRUE)
summary(m16)

#Model 17

##Nominal: distance from the edge
##Random effect: site
##Link: logistic
##Getting error message here
m17 <- clmm2(dmr_f_4 ~ dist_y_h, nominal = ~dbh, random = site_id, 
             data = modelling, link = "logistic", threshold = "flexible", 
             Hess = TRUE)
warnings(m17)

#Run LR ratio tests
#Non-proportional odds significant for distance from the edge but not dbh
anova(m15, m16)
anova(m15, m17)
```

Another option that often produces similar results to nominal effects is 
allowing for scale effects. This allows for the scale parameter of the 
underlying probability density function to change with the predictor. The 
advantage is you only have to fit one additional parameter (as oopose to J-1
with nominal effects) and interpreting the model is easier because the effect
of the predictor is the same across all levels of the response (J). 
```{r}
#Fit scale effect for distance from the edge

#Model 18
##Predictor: distance from the edge and dbh
##Scale: distance from the edge
##Random effect: site
##Link: logistic
##Getting warning that random effects are not converging
m18 <- clmm2(dmr_f_4 ~ dbh, scale = ~dist_y_h, random = site_id, 
             data = modelling, link = "logistic", threshold = "flexible", 
             Hess = TRUE)
warnings(m18)

#Compare this model to the one with nominal effect. Not that the model allowing
#for scale effects is nested in the model with nominal effects. 
#Nominal effects model significantly better
AIC(m16); AIC(m18)
anova(m16, m18)
```

Okay at this point, we have a good working model that is approaching a Hessian
condition that indicates the model is ill-formed. Try adding site level 
variables and see if the model converges. 
```{r}

##Getting model predictions
Next step is to understand how to get predictions from these models. 
```{r}
#Model 22: dmr ~ dbh.s + distance from edge.s (nominal) + site (random)
summary(m22)

#Model 23: dmr ~ dbh.s + distance from edge.s + site (random)
summary(m23)

#Start by expecting some of the model elements
#Betas coefficients of predictors specified as location (normal, not nominal) 
#effects
m22$beta

#Threshold parameters, which I think are also the nominal coefficients for each
#level logit (j boundary)=
m22$xi

#All the coefficients (location, nominal, thresholds and also one that is used 
#in the link function) 
m22$coefficients

#Random effect estimates. More specifically, the documentations says these are
#the "conditonal modes" of the random effects. There are also estimates of the
#conditional variance for each random effect estimate. 
m22$ranef
m22$condVar

#Fitted values. These are probabilities for each observation in the dataset
#conditional on the random effect. 
#For example, observation 1 is from cr_1, has a dmr of (IBLC-2) and, has a 
#scaled dbh of 1.07 and a scaled distance from the edge of -0.910. The fitted
#value tells you the probability of IBLC-2 at those x values and cr_1 site
modelling %>% select(dmr_f_4, dbh.s, dist_y_h.s, site_id) %>% slice(1)
m22$fitted.values %>% head()

#To get predicted values for the average site (no random effect) you use the 
#predict function.
#Note: if you just run predict(model), you get the conditional predicted
#probabilities
predict(m22, newdata = modelling) %>% head()

#A few other things in the model object
#True or false indicating if the model converged
m22$convergence

#Vector of the response variable in the original dataframe
m22$y

#Levels of the response variable
m22$lev
```

Check understanding by calculating the fitted value of the first 
observation by hand. The model is: 
$\text{dmr_f_4} \sim \text{dbh.s} + \text{(1 | site_id)} \quad \text{with nominal effect:} \quad \sim \text{dist_y_h.s}$

```{r}
#Extract first observation
obs1 <- modelling %>% select(dmr_f_4, dbh.s, dist_y_h.s, site_id) %>% 
  slice(1)
obs1

#Save dbh and distance values as simple numerics
obs1.num <- obs1 %>% select(dbh.s, dist_y_h.s) %>% unlist()

#Compare the what the fitted value for the first observation was
m22$fitted.values %>% head(1)

#Model summary
summary(m22)

#Calculate the logit(odds) (= underlying latent variable) for P(Y<=0) and 
#P(Y<=IBLC-2). 
m22$coefficients
lgit1 <- (m22$coefficients[1] + m22$coefficients[3]*obs1.num[2]) - 
  m22$coefficients[5]*obs1.num[1] - m22$ranef[1]
lgit2 <- (m22$coefficients[2] + m22$coefficients[4]*obs1.num[2]) - 
  m22$coefficients[5]*obs1.num[1] - m22$ranef[1]

#These are on the log odds scale. Convert these to the estimated cumulative 
#probability by taking the inverse of the logit, which the plogis() function
#does
plogis(lgit1) #P(Y<=0)
plogis(lgit2) #P(Y<=IBLC-2)

#Subtract the cumulative probabilities to get P(Y = IBLC-2) and compare with
#the fitted value (should be identical)
p_iblc2 <- plogis(lgit2) - plogis(lgit1)
p_iblc2
m22$fitted.values %>% head(1)
```

The fitted values in the model object only provide the estimated probability 
for the observed DMR value of each observation. To assess the classification
accuracy, we need estimates of each DMR level for each observation and then we
can compare it to what the observed DMR was. 
```{r}
#Replicate the original data
pred_re_m22 <- data.frame(tree_id = modelling$tree_id,
                dmr_f_4 = factor(modelling$dmr_f_4),
                dist_y_h.s = modelling$dist_y_h.s,
                dbh.s = modelling$dbh.s,
                site_id = modelling$site_id)

#Epred_re_m22tract random effects, add them to the dataframe by site_id
ranef_m22 <- data.frame(ranef = m22$ranef, site_id = unique(modelling$site_id))
pred_re_m22 <- left_join(pred_re_m22, ranef_m22, by = "site_id")

#Calcualte cumulative probabilities: P(DMR<=0) and P(DMR<= IBLC-2)
summary(m22)
pred_re_m22 <- pred_re_m22 %>% 
  mutate(cp_0 = plogis((coef_m22[1] + coef_m22[3]*dist_y_h.s) - 
           coef_m22[5]*dbh.s - ranef),
         cp_IBLC2 = plogis((coef_m22[2] + coef_m22[4]*dist_y_h.s) - 
           coef_m22[5]*dbh.s - ranef)
         )

#Calculate epred_re_m22act probabilities of each level
pred_re_m22 <- pred_re_m22 %>% 
  mutate(prob_0 = cp_0,
         prob_IBLC_2 = cp_IBLC2 - cp_0,
         prob_3_5 = 1- cp_IBLC2)
```

##Testing classification accuracy
Plot the predicted probabilities of each level to see if there is good 
separation. i.e. for a tree that has an observed dmr of IBLC-2, is the 
probability of that level higher (and separated) from the probabilities of the
other levels?
```{r}
#Gather columns of predicted probabilities
x <- pred_re_m22 %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("prob"),
               values_to = "prob",
               names_to = "pred_dmr",
               names_prefix = "prob_") %>% 
  mutate(pred_dmr = factor(pred_dmr, levels = c("0", "IBLC_2", "3_5")))

#Plot
ggplot(x, aes(x = prob, y = pred_dmr)) + 
  geom_jitter() + 
  geom_boxplot(outliers = FALSE, fill = NA) +
  facet_wrap(~dmr_f_4)
```

Calculate kappa 
```{r}
#First step is to generate a confusion matrix. 

#Create a function to evaluate which response level has the highest 
#probability, then save that level. 
f_pred_dmr_high <- function(pred_prob_df, dmr_lev) {
  #Apply function to each row to find the column index of the max probability
  max_index <- apply(pred_prob_df, 1, which.max)
  
  # Use the index to select the corresponding level
  pred_dmr <- dmr_lev[max_index]
  
  # Return as a factor with specified levels
  return(factor(pred_dmr, levels = dmr_lev))
}

#Save levels of dmr
dmr_lev <- levels(modelling$dmr_f_4)

#Subset dataframe to just columns that have probabilities of each level
x <- pred_re_m22 %>% 
  select(starts_with("prob"))

#Apply function to get predicted dmr
pred_re_m22 <- pred_re_m22 %>% 
  mutate(pred_dmr = f_pred_dmr_high(x, dmr_lev))

#Generate a confusion matrix. Used the conf_mat() function in the {yardstick}
#package. 
cm_m22 <- conf_mat(pred_re_m22, truth = dmr_f_4, estimate = pred_dmr)
cm_m22

#Calculate accuracy (i.e. the proportion of observations that were correctly 
#classified)
accuracy(pred_re_m22, truth = dmr_f_4, estimate = pred_dmr)

#Calculate kappa (i.e. the proportion of correct classifications normalized 
#by what you would expect based on chance alone). Weighted kappa is a version 
#of kappa that gives more value to close disagreements (than far ones). You can
#weight it in two ways: (1) quadratic, which weights values as a exponentially
#declining function as you move away from an observation and (2) linear, which
#weights values as a linear declining function as you move away from an 
#observation
kap(pred_re_m22, truth = dmr_f_4, estimate = pred_dmr)
kap(pred_re_m22, truth = dmr_f_4, estimate = pred_dmr, weighting = "quadratic")
kap(pred_re_m22, truth = dmr_f_4, estimate = pred_dmr, weighting = "linear")
```

Assigning a DMR based on the response level with the probability is arbitrary. 
Instead, assign using a weighted dice roll. The "dice" has the same number of 
sides as there are levels in the response. The probability of each side, is the 
probability of that level in the response. Here, we do one dice roll for each 
observation and get a DMR value. This is what I am imagining we will do when we
extend this to the stand scale predictive model, so really what we are
interested in is if this produces similar levels of infection at a site level;
predicting individual trees isn't as important as predicting % infection at the 
site. 
```{r}
#With help from ChatGPT
#Function to assign a response level using weighted probabilities
f_pred_dmr_wt <- function(pred_prob_df, dmr_lev) {
  # Apply function to each row to sample a level with weighted probabilities
  pred_dmr <- apply(pred_prob_df, 1, function(probabilities) {
    # Use sample() to randomly select a level with probabilities as weights
    sample(dmr_lev, size = 1, prob = probabilities)
  })
  
  # Return as a factor with specified levels
  return(factor(pred_dmr, levels = dmr_lev))
}

# Subset dataframe to just columns that have probabilities of each level
x <- pred_re_m22 %>%
  select(starts_with("prob"))

# Apply the new function to get predicted dmr using weighted sampling
pred_re_m22 <- pred_re_m22 %>%
  mutate(pred_dmr_wt = f_pred_dmr_wt(x, dmr_lev))
```

Compare the proportions of infected trees in each DMR response level based on
assigning a DMR with the highest probability and with a weighted dice roll.
```{r}
#Check the levels in the observed and predicted dmrs are the same
levels(pred_re_m22$dmr_f_4)
levels(pred_re_m22$pred_dmr)
